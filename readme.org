* Acknowledgements
 - This repository is a fork of [[https://github.com/alcah/qute-capture][qute-capture]], which also has a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dmenu][dmenu]] integration for reading org entries.
 - My workflow only requires the write capabilities of [[https://github.com/alcah/qute-capture][qute-capture]], therefore I removed the external dependencies.
